    "In this task, the client wants you to estimate the spatial prediction performance of K-nearest neighbor regression model with K=5 (5NN), using spatial leave-one-out cross-validation (i.e. SKCV, with number of folds == number of data points). The client wants you to use the C-index as the performance measure.  \n",

    "- output.csv, contains the water permebility values. \n",
    "- coordinates.csv, contains the corresponding geographical coordinate locations of the data points. The unit of the coordinates is metre, and you can use Euclidean distance to calculate distances between the coordinate points. \n",

    "#### 2. Perform spatial leave-one-out cross-validation with 5NN model for the provided data set (refer to the lectures 3.1.3 and 3.1.4 for help). Estimate the water permeability prediction performance (using 5NN model and C-index) with the following distance parameter values: d = 0, 10, 20, ..., 250 (that is, 10 meter intervals from 0m to 250m). \n",

    "- Your own implementation of the spatial leave-one-out cross-validation for the current task. Remember to also take advantage of earlier exercises (e.g. C-index). For the 5-nearest neighbor and Euclidean distance calculation you can use third-party libraries (e.g. Scikit-learn) if you want. Also, try to follow good programming practices and add comments to relevant parts of your code explaining what you are doing and why.\n",
