    "I have a task for you that concerns drug molecules and their targets. I have spent a lot of time in a laboratory to measure how strongly potential drug molecules bind to putative target molecules. I do not have enough resources to measure all possible drug-target pairs, so I would like to first predict their affinities and then measure only the most promising ones. I have already managed to create a model which I believe is good for this purpose. Its details are below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- algorithm: K-nearest neighbours regressor\n",
    "- parameters: K=20\n",
    "- training data: all the pairs for which I have measured the affinity\n",
    "\n",
    "The data I used to create the model is available in the files `input.data`, `output.data` and `pairs.data` for you to use. The first file contains the features of the pairs, whereas the second contains their affinities. The third file contains the identifiers of the drug and target molecules of which the pairs are composed. The files are paired, i.e. the i<sup>*th*</sup> row in each file is about the same pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not able to evaluate how well the model will perform if I use it to predict the affinities of new drug-target pairs. I need you to evaluate the model for me. There are three distinct situations in which I want to use this model in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because I have only measured the affinities for some of the possible pairs of the currently known drugs and targets, I want to use the model to predict the affinities for the remaining pairs.\n",
    "2. I am confident that I will discover new potential drug molecules in the future, so I will want to use the model to predict their affinities to the currently known targets.\n",
    "3. Because new putative target molecules, too, will likely be identified in the future, I will also want to use the model to predict the affinities between the drug molecules I will discover and the target molecules somebody else will discover in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please evaluate the generalisation performance of the model in these three situations. I need to get evaluation results from leave-one-out cross-validation with C-index. Also, because I'm worried that unreliable evaluation results will mislead me to waste precious resources, please explain why I can trust your results.\n",
